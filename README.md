Professional Carbon Programming — Chapter-by-Chapter Code Pack

This package contains all code snippets automatically extracted from Professional Carbon Programming series 3 (.docx) and organized per chapter. Every chapter is represented—even if no explicit code was found—so you can navigate and test examples without hunting through the manuscript.

What’s Inside

One folder per chapter: INTRODUCTION/, Chapter 1/, Chapter 2/, …

Multiple snippet files per chapter named like: chapter_01_snippet_1.carbon, chapter_01_snippet_2.sh, etc.

Smart file extensions (best-effort):

.carbon — Carbon language / generic code blocks

.cmake — CMake build configuration fragments

.sh — Shell/CLI commands (setup, tooling, demos)

.sql — SQL queries where detected

.ics — Calendar/automation examples (if present)

A top-level README.md (this file) describing structure and usage.

How the Extraction Works

Snippets were located using a blend of simple heuristics:

Fenced blocks using triple backticks (…)

Paragraphs styled as Code / Preformatted (when present in the DOCX)

Lines with code-like punctuation (e.g., braces, semicolons, ->, ::) and keywords (import, class, func, cmake_minimum_required, etc.)

Short indented blocks likely to be code
If a chapter had no clearly detectable code, a *_placeholder.txt is included so no chapter is missing.

⚠️ Limitations: Heuristics may occasionally include prose that looks like code or miss code that wasn’t clearly marked. If you want stricter (only fenced) or looser (include indented prose) rules, I can regenerate the pack accordingly.

Quick Start

Unzip the archive.

Open a chapter folder and review the *.carbon / *.sh / *.cmake files.

For shell examples on macOS/Linux:

chmod +x *.sh
./chapter_01_snippet_2.sh


For build/config examples, copy the *.cmake fragments into a small test project and run cmake .. && cmake --build . as appropriate.

Use the snippets as reference & scaffolding while reading the corresponding chapter.

File Naming Convention

<chapter_name_normalized>_snippet_<N>.<ext>
Examples: chapter_03_snippet_1.carbon, chapter_07_snippet_2.cmake

Reproducibility & Next Steps

This pack was generated from the uploaded manuscript with deterministic rules.

Want merged per-chapter files, language-specific folders, or a runnable demo project? I can produce those variants in a new ZIP.
